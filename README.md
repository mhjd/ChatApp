## Access the Application
The project is accessible at [this address](https://chat-app-internship.vercel.app/).
Please Wait a little bit for the loading of the models. 

## Run the Project
Run:
```bash
pnpm dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the application.

## Test the Project

You can send messages.  
When there is not enough space on the screen, a scroll bar appears, and the view stays on the latest message.  
It is also possible to change the model language in the menu at the top.

When you click on "New chat" it opens a new conversation and saves the current one (if there is). You can then access it (along with other previous conversations) from the menu on the left.

## Information
You can access all my messages with Aider.chat in the .aider.input.history file.
Aider.chat is an open-source command-line app that allows you to interact with a code project using an LLM.
