+I want you to change the PromptInput in page.tsx. It should be displayed at the bottom of the page and not in the middle like actually. Also, I want the Button having the same height than the TextField.

# 2024-11-13 16:03:50.236927
+List me the changement that you have done, for each chunk of code that you have added or modified. Because currently, the prompt is effectively on the bottom of the page but I don't like it, because I have to scroll.

# 2024-11-13 16:04:41.106243
+/ask There is still a little bit scroll. I don't want any scroll because it's not needed. What should I do to have this behaviour

# 2024-11-13 16:12:27.203459
+I want you to create a function that, on a click on the button of PromptInput component, it should add update the listOfMessages with setListOfMessages, with the content of the TextField. 

# 2024-11-13 16:17:24.959449
+Now I want that you display the messages above the TextField. The first message will be on the top of the page. And when a new message is send, it appear below the last message.

# 2024-11-13 16:19:15.342874
+I have an issue, when the messages arrive at the level of the input field, it should scroll, to not be uppon the TextField.

# 2024-11-13 16:20:48.789817
+Multiple line messages are displayed in one line, and it's isn't what we want. Instead, we want it to be displayed as it's in the TextField, before we sent it

# 2024-11-13 16:31:54.876322
+Now I want to have a response to these messages. So, when a message will be send, a response will be displayed as the chatbot have responded. For now, I don't have implemented the connexion with the api so I just want the displaying of a generic response : "Hello world!!!!". The responses should have another background color than the user messages background color, to be easily differenciable from them. The response will be added to the chat when clicking on the send button, so it will be on the handleSubmit function. Why? because we want later to have a real response of a real chatbot, and I don't want to change the structure of the code.

# 2024-11-13 16:43:58.127175
+Now I want a menu on the left with all passed chats. And on the top of this menu, a button "New chat". When clicking on "New Chat", it will save the current list of messages in a new context named "history", that will be a list of tuple (the list of messages of this chat, that's a list, and the title of this chat, that's a string), and the new list of messages "messages" will be an empty list. Each chat will have a generic name : "<number of the chat> This is a generic name that's extremely long to see if, as intended, all the title isn't displayed". All the existing chats will be displayed on the menu. The height of the menu will be the height of the user screen and when there is too many messages for being displayed in that place, there will be scroll. The list of messages is in chronologic order, with the more recent messages on top of older messages.

# 2024-11-13 16:45:27.383786
+There is many bugs :

# 2024-11-13 16:50:01.544905
+So, there is many issues : 1. when we click on a message, it create a new chat on the menu, it's isn't normal, clicking on chat title should only open the chat, not changing anything on the menu. 2. Also, when there is too many messages, there is no scroll, but discussion title overlap each other. 3. And finally, when we open the app, New Chat button is in the right place, but when the page have finally loaded, the New Chat button is comes out of the visible part of the window (we only see the half of the button).

# 2024-11-13 16:51:20.350551
+So now, the PromptInput is on the wrong place, it's on the menu instead being on the right place, at the right of the menu, as before

# 2024-11-13 16:52:41.320713
+PromptInput is now on the right place, but the TextField is ridiculously small, we cannot even see two characters

# 2024-11-13 16:53:38.063218
+you have changed the height instead the width, the TextField should take all the width that's possible

# 2024-11-13 22:02:58.995241
+/ask there is still the same issue. I think it's due to the map. The map on messages do nothing at the beginning because the list of messages is empty. So, the problem is probably due to the .main class and its element.

# 2024-11-13 22:13:00.278347
+/ask There is an issue. When clicking on "New chat", it add a new line on chat menu, where we can access to the current chat. The issue is that when we are clicking on "New chat", while being on an already created chat (like for example, the first chat, in a list of 10 chats), it will dupplicate the chat which we are on (in the example, it will duplicate the first chat). What are the different approcheas to solve this issue?

# 2024-11-13 22:25:30.396932
+/ask If we are in an old chat, and we are adding new messages, and going to another chat or a new chat, there is an issue. The issue is that the new messages aren't presenet when we go back to this old chat. It's due to the fact that the history is not updated. What are the different way to fix this issue?

# 2024-11-14 00:43:51.069329
+/ask I want to add the ai part of this chatbot ai project. To do that, I will do an api call. Can I do it without a server part code (node.js) and still be able to deploy it on vercel without having to reveal my API key to the user ?

# 2024-11-25 19:26:14.820433
+Here is my handling of retrieving list of models, in mistral.ts file (api) :
+```js
+    if (req.method === 'GET') {
+        try {
+            const modelsResponse = await client.models.list();
+				const modelsSimplified = modelsResponse.data.map((model : any) => ({ id: model.id, name: model.name }));
+            res.status(200).json({ models: modelsSimplified });
+        } catch (error) {
+            console.error('Error fetching Mistral models:', error);
+            res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to fetch models from Mistral API' });
+        }
+```
+
+I retrieve a JSon response.
+modelsResponse.data contain a list of json object, corresponding to information fo each model :
+```json
+{
+
+    "object": "list",
+    "data": 
+
+[
+
+{
+
+    "id": "string",
+    "object": "model",
+    "created": 0,
+    "owned_by": "mistralai",
+    "capabilities": 
+
+            {},
+            "name": "string",
+            "description": "string",
+            "max_context_length": 32768,
+            "aliases": [ ],
+            "deprecation": "2019-08-24T14:15:22Z",
+            "default_model_temperature": 0,
+            "type": "base"
+        }
+    ]
+
+}
+```
+I don't need all this information, so I do a map for fitlering the only information I'm insterested in (id and name of each model) :
+```ts
+const modelsSimplified = modelsResponse.data.map((model : any) => ({ id: model.id, name: model.name }));
+```
+
+
+The issue is that I have this error :
+```
+src/pages/api/mistral_api.ts:21:30 - error TS18048: 'modelsResponse.data' is possibly 'undefined'.
+
+21     const modelsSimplified = modelsResponse.data.map((model : any) => ({ id: model.id, name: model.name }));
+                                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+```
+
+So firstly, I want that you analyze if I do it (sending only information that matter) propertly. If modification is needed, I want you to tell me what should I do.
+
+Then, tell me, in page.tsx, what are the modification I need to do.
+Presently, what I do is that :
+```ts
+
+        const response = await fetch('/api/mistral_api');
+        const data = await response.json();
+        setLoading(false);
+		  setModels(data.models);
+```
+I know that I shouldn't do `data.models` anymore for retrieving models, so what should I do?
+models should contain a list of Model type :
+```ts
+type Model = {
+  id: string;
+  name: string;
+};
+```
+So setModels should take a list of Model in parameter.

+Now I have this error : Error: Error: Failed to fetch models
+    _ NextJS

# 2024-11-25 20:47:37.679766
+I have this error : `Failed to fetch models`
+That come from this piece of code, in ModelsMenu function :
+```ts
+const response = await fetch('/api/mistral_api');
+if (!response.ok) {
+  throw new Error('Failed to fetch models');
+}
+```
+
+Why I have this error on vercel but it works locally?
